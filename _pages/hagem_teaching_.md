Teaching at the University of Michigan has been a privilege. At Ross, I
have taught the BBA core applied economics course BE300 five times since
joining in Fall 2021. In the Department of Economics, I taught several
iterations of the undergraduate econometrics elective Econ452, the PhD
core econometrics class Econ672, and the second-year econometric theory
field sequence Econ678-Econ679. I have received consistently high
ratings for all of my classes both in Ross and in Economics. I arrived
at these ratings through careful preparation and iteration. After every
class, I take detailed notes on what did not work well so I can do
better next time. In the classroom, my students appreciate that I do not
expect them to get everything exactly right on the first try either.
Continuous refinement of my teaching has allowed me to excel in diverse
classroom settings, with different audiences, subjects, and proficiency
levels. Below is a summary of my teaching.

## Teaching at Ross {#teaching-at-ross}

I taught two sections of BE300 during the 2021/22 academic year (75+34
students) and three sections of BE300 during the 2022/23 academic year
(73+80+78 students). The 2021/22 sections were coordinated with other
instructors. For the 2022/23 sections, I was the sole instructor. For
four of the five sections, the fraction of students who described me as
a very good or excellent teacher (Q2) was above the Ross BBA core
averages of 85 percent (2021/22 academic year) and 83 percent (2022/23
academic year). For instance, 87, 92, and 88 percent of my students
agreed that I was an excellent teacher in my three 2022/23 sections. My
classes are highly interactive and my students enjoy several
action-based learning experiences such as repeated negotiations,
auctions under uncertainty, and computer-based market simulations.

## Teaching in Economics {#teaching-in-economics}

I have taught four courses in the Department of Economics at Michigan,
(i) Econ452, (ii) Econ672, (iii) Econ678, and (iv) Econ679. Econ452 is
an intermediate econometrics class for students who plan to attend
graduate school in business or economics. My approach to teaching
Econ452 is to split the course into two halves. In the first half of the
course, I introduce students to data driven decision making and
immediately apply these concepts by analyzing data sets in a statistical
software package. In the second half, we spend most of the lecture
discussing high-profile research papers from economics and public
policy. For four of the five times I taught this course, the fraction of
students who described me as a very good or excellent teacher (Q2
equivalent, see table[^1] below) was well above 90 percent. I was nominated
for an Golden Apple award by my Econ452 class in Winter 2021.

[^1]: Percent of students who 'Agree' or 'Strongly Agree' to "Overall, Andreas Hagemann was an excellent teacher. (Q2)"

Econ672 is the second econometrics course that graduate students in
economics take. It is also attended by a wide variety of students from
across the University, including Ross (Accounting, Business Economics,
Finance, Marketing, Strategy, and Management & Organizations), the Ford
School of Public Policy, and the School of Information. The main goal is
enabling all students to understand and to apply modern econometric
methods. A secondary goal is to prepare students interested in
econometrics for the econometric theory field sequence. I taught this
course four times. The fraction of students who described me as a very
good or excellent teacher (Q2 equivalent) was 100 percent three times
and 94 percent one time.

The other two courses I have taught, Econ678 and Econ679, are the first
and second part of the econometric theory field sequence. The audience
for these courses is typically much smaller and has an interest in
econometrics. Most students are from Economics, although students from
Finance, Statistics, and Mathematics often attend these courses. The
discussion in Econ678 focuses on advanced econometric methods and proof
techniques that enable students to understand and to modify established
methods and proof strategies. By the end of Econ679, students should be
able to come up with their own ways of approaching an econometric or
mathematical problem and should be near the frontier of the current
state of econometric research. The fraction of students who described me
as a very good or excellent teacher (Q2 equivalent) was 100 percent for
each of the six times I taught these courses.

## Outlook {#outlook}

I am looking forward to expanding my teaching at Ross both at the
undergraduate and graduate level. I am planning on proposing a BBA
**capstone** course on **data-driven decision making** in business and
economics. This proposed course would introduce students to methods from
machine learning, statistics, and economics to make better decisions for
themselves, their future employers, and their future customers. I am
also planning on expanding the **applied econometrics** education for
our Ross PhD students with a course that introduces modern empirical
methods with a focus on building intuition. An exceptionally popular
course on this topic and with this goal used to be offered in Economics.
My proposal is to expand the current "Topics in BE I" (BE 887) course to
a full semester course that fills this gap.

## Quotes from students {#quotes-from-students}

Below are some quotes from students about BE300, Econ452, and Econ672.

### From the evaluations of BE300 {#from-the-evaluations-of-be300}

"As a professor, he was always incredibly encouraging and would go out
of his way to help students. It is true that sometimes the content would
be confusing, but he would always be willing to help those who asked him
questions after class and he always was incredibly understanding and
supportive. He is by far one of the best professors I have had at the
University of Michigan.""Hagemann is so good at sticking with students
when we have questions and thoroughly explaining any confusions we have.
He also is very clear in explaining challenging topics - when I read the
textbook alone I get confused but he always makes sure I understand the
concept by the end of the lecture. And if I have a follow up later on,
he is always available to help.""Professor Hagemann might be one of the
best professors I've had, and certainly is for economics. He works to
explain material very clearly the first time, but also can adjust his
explanations to suit all students in the class and answers questions
very well. Lectures were useful and full of practice that helped a lot.
He is also incredibly nice and understanding, he definitely cares about
his students on top of teaching amazingly well.""The material was
explained in a concise way, yet our professor made sure to acknowledge
nuances that were necessary to understand for practice problems. I have
taken numerous econ courses in my time at high school and in college,
yet I felt that this course was my favorite; I left this course feeling
that I could understand the material best out of all of my previous
courses as well. Professor Hagemann made it very clear what was expected
of us and was rational, empathetic and approachable."

### From the evaluations of Econ452 {#from-the-evaluations-of-econ452}

"Excellent instruction. He wanted you to leave the class with an
understanding of the material that you would need and the skills to use
it, and everything in the class was geared towards that end. He didn't
assign busywork and he didn't test on things that students will have no
use for after the class. He was an entertaining, humorous, and very
straight--forward teacher and anyone would be lucky to learn from him."

"Andreas Hagemann is not only extremely qualified and knowledgeable, he
made it a point to be approachable and relate to his students,
recounting how much difficulty he had learning these concepts at his age
and trying to convey information to us in a way he wish it had been
taught to him. Additionally, he was very sensitive to cultural issues
(some of the lessons involved datasets on topics like wage gaps and he
was very mindful in approaching these topics). Enjoyed the class and a
big fan of Dr. Hagemann"

"I loved the way this course was taught. I found myself enjoying stats,
something I wasn't sure was possible. Professor Hagemann explained the
material well which was really nice. He also seemed to genuinely want us
to succeed."

### From a Golden Apple nomination for Econ452 {#from-a-golden-apple-nomination-for-econ452}

"He changed the way I thought about using statistics. \[...\] ECON 452
with Prof Hagemann not only prepped me for other more advanced stats
classes but inspired in me a much greater appreciation and interest in
statistics in general. I changed my academic journey and career path to
further explore the field because of this class."

### From the evaluations of Econ672 {#from-the-evaluations-of-econ672}

"Andreas was one of the best instructors in the first year econ
sequence. He is approachable, humorous and extremely open to questions
during class. His answers to questions were one of the most valuable
contributions to the class. His organization was also impeccable."

"Andreas did an excellent job of making complex concepts understandable
and provided helpful intuition for the main concepts. He also went at
just the right pace and always gave students a chance to ask questions.
Overall, this was an excellent course and I would hope that more
professors would teach in this matter."
